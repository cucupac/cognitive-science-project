Two small, knee-height animals with youthful, soft fur. The left has a tan coat with an even tone, short snout, floppy ears, and is being supported upright in a personâ€™s hands. The right one sports a black coat with tan paws, slightly longer ears, and a gentle gaze. Both appear playful and relaxed, outdoors without visible accessories.
