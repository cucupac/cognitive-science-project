Medium-sized, slender build, white fur with a light brown patch on the head. Short, smooth coat. Lying down, relaxed demeanor. Upright ears, medium length tail curved by its side. Yellow collar with tag. Eyes gazing forward with calm expression. Indoors, resting on concrete floor beneath rusted metal table, with a green blanket nearby.
