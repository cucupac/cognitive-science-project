Two small, slender animals with short, light gray fur and darker, subtle striped patterns across the body and limbs. Prominent, upright ears and round, alert eyes. Both animals lie calmly on a black, reflective surface, front paws outstretched. Relaxed demeanor, pointing ears forward. Indoors, no visible accessories.
