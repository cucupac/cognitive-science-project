Three medium-sized animals lie relaxed on a patterned carpet in an indoor setting. The foreground animal has dense, short tabby fur with dark stripes and elongated ears. It gazes forward, its long tail stretched behind. The other animals display similar builds, with one exhibiting golden hues and the other a mix of stripes and spots.
