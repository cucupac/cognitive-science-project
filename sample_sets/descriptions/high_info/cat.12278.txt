Four small animals, similar to hand-size, with sleek black and white fur, lie and sit atop a bright pink blanket in a metallic enclosure. Alert yet relaxed postures, large upright ears, and short snouts. Long tails curl gently. Each has sharp, bright eyes, some gazing outward. Nearby: a food bowl on tiled ground.
