Two slender, small animals with short fur. One has a mix of orange, black, and white patches, with large pointed ears and a pink nose, sitting upright. The other has gray and white fur with subtle striping, lying down. Both have long, straight tails and alert expressions. Indoors in a cage setting, no accessories visible.
