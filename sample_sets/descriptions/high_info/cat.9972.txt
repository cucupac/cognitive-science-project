A medium-sized animal, about knee-height, with sleek, shiny black fur, lying calmly on a beige carpeted surface. It has a slender build with a distinctive long, curled tail. Erect ears, bright yellow eyes, and a short snout characterize its alert gaze. It's indoors, near a window with a view of greenery outside.
