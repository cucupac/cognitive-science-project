The small animals have medium-length black fur with dense, fluffy textures. They are nestled together on a soft, crumpled blanket inside a metal cage, their tiny bodies barely larger than a human hand. Ears are pointed and alert, with a relaxed, gentle demeanor, and round eyes gaze softly forward. The environment features floral wallpaper and a window lighting the scene.
